# Shaun's Coding Quiz

Welcome to the README for Shaun's Coding Quiz!

**User Story**: AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

This app utilizes HTML, CSS, Javascript, & Web APis to create a multiple-choice quiz with the ability to save the user scores. The user has 60 seconds to answer 5 questions; earning 1 point for each correct answer, and receiving a -10 second penalty for each incorrect answer. Upon completion, the user has the option to save their score, and can view and clear the bank of saved scores.
